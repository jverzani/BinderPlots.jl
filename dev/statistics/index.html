to easily create some of the basic graphics of statistics. <code>BinderPlots</code> does not attempt to provide an interface for these graphics, rather the underlying <code>Plotly</code> interface would be used. This section shows some example usage.</p><p>The basic graphics of statistics show distributions (what can be and how often that something occurs) and basic relationships (especially between an explanatory and response variable).</p><p>In the following the data is either numeric or categorical. The data may be passed along via the positional arguments of <code>plot</code> or as named arguments to pass directly to <code>PlotlyLight</code>. The <code>plot</code> interface allows for a grouping value, to be described later. Series attributes are passed along through keywords. Some of the graphics require adjustments to the underlying layout.</p><p>The different grqphics we discuss are defined by the <code>seriestype</code>. We have <code>:histogram</code>, <code>:histogram2d</code>, <code>:bar</code>, <code>:pie</code>, <code>:boxplot</code>, in addition to <code>:scatter</code>.</p><p>A histogram is a familiar graphic to illustrate the distribution of a single numeric data set. By passing the data in as the <code>x</code> argument the graphic is easy to construct:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">x = rand(100)

<p>Passing the data into the first, <code>x</code>,  argument position instructs the drawing of vertical box plots, using the second, <code>y</code>, argument (by padding the first position with <code>nothing</code>) produces  a vertical box plot.</p><h2 id="Relationships,-grouping"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Relationships,-grouping">Relationships, grouping</a><a id="Relationships,-grouping-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Relationships,-grouping" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Statistics graphics are also used to show relationships between variables. In the example of the bar plot, two data sets are shown together. A common format for storing multiple datasets is &quot;long format&quot; where data is structured with each row representing a case and each column recording the value of a variable for each case. For the data in the bar plot example, this would be <code>[10, 20, 30, 5, 6, 8]</code>, <code>[&quot;giraffes&quot;, &quot;orangutans&quot;, &quot;monkeys&quot;,&quot;giraffes&quot;, &quot;orangutans&quot;, &quot;monkeys&quot;]</code>, and <code>[&quot;zoo 1&quot;, &quot;zoo 1&quot;, &quot;zoo 1&quot;, &quot;zoo 2&quot;, &quot;zoo 2&quot;, &quot;zoo 2&quot;]</code> to indicate the group. This format lends itself to the &quot;split-apply-combine&quot; data processing style where the data is split into groups, a function is applied to each group, and then the results are then combined. For this application, the apply step is to visually represent the grouped data; the combine step displays each series as a whole.</p><p>Splitting the data on the grouping variable can be done in different ways. If this variable is passed to the <code>group</code> argument for these graphics, the <code>SplitApplyCombine.group</code> function handles the grouping.</p><p>For example, were the data given in long format, the following call to <code>plot</code> passes the splitting part off:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">cnt = [10, 20, 30, 5, 6, 8]
a = [&quot;giraffes&quot;, &quot;orangutans&quot;, &quot;monkeys&quot;,&quot;giraffes&quot;, &quot;orangutans&quot;, &quot;monkeys&quot;]
